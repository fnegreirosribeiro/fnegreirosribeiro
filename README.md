### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fabio and I'm a physicist with a passion for Artifical Inteligence. After doing it as a hobby for several years, I finnaly decided to make a career change. I have graduated in a Data Science courses from Digital House and I am now developing my own projects and participating in Kaggle competitions to improve my skills.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer in Mercado Libre, Argentina. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open for collaboration! I code in Python and C++, and I am very comfortable using terminals and writing Bash scripts, since I am a heavy Linux user.

ðŸ“« Reach me!
