### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fabio and I'm a physicist with a passion for Artifical Inteligence. After doing it as a hobby for several years, I finnaly decided to make a career change. I have graduated in a Data Science courses from Digital House and I am now developing my own projects and participating in Kaggle competitions to improve my skills.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Researcher in the National University of Cordoba, in Argentina. I work with numerical simulations, modelling chemical and physical processes, such as catalysis. In a daily basis, I mostly write codes in Python and C++ to automate repetitive tasks and to perform analysis of large amount of data.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing the online course "Become a Deep Reinforcement Learning Expert" in Udacity. I am hoping to improve and master Reinforcement Learning, which is one of my main passions in the Artifical Inteligence world.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open for collaboration! I code in Python and C++, and I am very comfortable using terminals and writing Bash scripts, since I am a heavy Linux user.

ðŸ“« Reach me!
